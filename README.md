This repo contains all the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) code for my video "[How to Extend the Sum of Any Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkn9zeRuzHs)".

This code was written for a slightly modified version of Manim Community v1.19.0. (I put a couple band-aid fixes for some minor bugs. I don't have my tweaks in a public repo right now, but almost everything should work with a regular Manim installation.)

The python files in the root contain the scenes. Each of these files roughly corresponds to a section of the video. Some helper methods and custom objects can be found in `modules`.

I would not look to this repo for an example of proper, clean Manim code. I did not write it to be maintainable or readable by anyone else (or even my future self); I wrote it to make animations that looked right, and then to be forgotten. I'm sure there are some sketchy hacks and silly variable names that I've forgotten about.
